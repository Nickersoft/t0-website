question: How is t-0 different from existing payment networks like SWIFT?
---

t-0 replaces multi-bank correspondent chains with a direct, programmable network connecting licensed institutions. Instead of prefunding accounts and waiting days for settlement, participants net balances periodically using USDT - enabling faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments.
